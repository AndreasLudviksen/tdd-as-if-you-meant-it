# Test-Driven Development as if you meant it
An exercise for pushing Test-Driven Development to its limits.

## Test-Driven Development isn't complicated
1. Add a little test
1. Run all the tests and watch the new one fail
1. Make a little change
1. Run all the tests and watch the new one pass
1. Refactor to remove duplication
1. Repeat until done

## But we observe many people doing "Pseudo-TDD"

# Let's turn it up to eleven
- This exercise turns up the TDD design constraints to full volume
- It's intended to show how unexpected designs can emerge from 
the process
- It's an exercise, it's _not_ intended for everyday use
- It's suprisingly hard to get started

## TDD is about detailed feedback on design choices
 
- Thinking about solutions is not getting feedback
- Feedback comes from tests
 
_Therefore_:

Run tests early

- No, _much_ earlier than that
 
Run tests often

- No, _much_ more often than that

## In TDD, design thinking happens during refactoring

> "Improving the design of existing code"

Existing code _that you know works_

# The exercise

### Write code that, given a series of Tic-Tac-Toe<sup>[1]</sup> moves, describes the state of the game.

1] Also known as "Noughts-and-crosses"

# Rules of the exercise

- Write one new test: The _smallest you can think of_ that seems to
  point in the direction of a solution.
- Watch it fail
- Make the test pass by writing the least implementation code you can
  _in the test method_
- Refactor as required. To create new structure that's not test code, 
  apply these steps _very strictly_.
  - _methods_:
      - (preferred) `Extract Method` to create a new method in the test class
      - (if necessary) Move code into an existing method
  - _types_:
      - create classes only to provide a destination for `Move Method`. 
      - Populate classes by moving definitions from tests, not the other way round.
- The person not typing makes sure that these rules are being followed _exactly_.

# Version control

- check in on every green bar
- describe your current design thinking in the comment

----

# Discussion

- How did that feel?
- What is your code like?
- Any lessons learned?

Remember, _this is just an exercise_

There's a sample solution the `candidate-solution` branch of this repository
